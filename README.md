DU Data Analytics Bootcam Homework #10 SQL-Challenge

In this challenge, I created the schema for a database using quickdatabasediagrams.com, exported the code for the shcema to be loaded in PostgreSQL, pasted the code in PostgreSQL, and executed it to create all of the tables and relationships within the database.  I saved a .sql file containing the SQL code for setting up the schemata as schemata.sql.  I then imported the data from 6 .csv files that were provided into the corresponding tables in the database.  Finally, I was able to run eight successful queries according to the provided instructions.  I saved the SQL code for the queries to another SQL file, sql-challenge-queries.sql.
